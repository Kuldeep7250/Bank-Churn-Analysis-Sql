#BANK CHURN ANALYSIS

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to uncover insights into financial behavior, credit utilization, income patterns, and risk assessment. Instead of solely concentrating on churn prediction, the objective is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance banking operations, optimize customer engagement, and improve financial decision-making.
Banks generate vast amounts of transactional and behavioral data, which, when analyzed effectively, can help refine customer segmentation, assess credit risk, detect potential fraud, and enhance financial product offerings. This project aims to transform raw banking data into actionable intelligence that drives stability, customer retention, and profitability.

Key Areas of Analysis

1. Customer Segmentation
•	Categorizing customers based on age, income level, education, and credit behavior.
•	Understanding spending habits and financial priorities across demographics.
2. Credit Utilization & Risk Assessment
•	Identifying customers with high credit utilization ratios, indicating potential financial stress.
•	Classifying customers into low, moderate, and high credit risk categories.
3. Spending Behavior & Financial Health
•	Analyzing income vs. expenditure patterns to evaluate financial stability.
•	Identifying customers with low balances and high credit dependency.
4. High-Value Customer Identification
•	Recognizing customers with high balances, premium credit cards, and long banking relationships.
•	Offering personalized services to maximize engagement and retention.
5. Dormant & High-Risk Accounts
•	Detecting customers with low transaction activity and long inactive periods.
•	Developing re-engagement strategies to improve retention and prevent attrition.
